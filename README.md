Diabetes prediction using logistic regression
Logistic regression is always good for binary classification.
We have 8 features variable and 1 target variable. 
I trained the data by splitting it into training data and testing data.
I used the logistic regression model to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.
The accuracy of the test data is 77%
